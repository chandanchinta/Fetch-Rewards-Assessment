Hi team,

I've completed an initial analysis of our receipt data and wanted to share some key findings and questions. I'd appreciate your insights to help us improve data quality and system performance.
Key Findings:

Price Consistency Issues


We're seeing cases where the receipt total doesn't match the sum of individual items
Some items show discrepancies between their listed price and final price
Question: Are these discrepancies due to discounts/promotions that aren't being captured, or is this a data entry issue?


Receipt Item Tracking


Noticed instances where the declared item count doesn't match the actual number of items
Some receipts have duplicate items with identical barcodes
Question: How should we handle cases where customers buy multiple identical items? Should they be consolidated or kept separate?


User-Flagged Data


Users are manually correcting some item information (prices, barcodes, quantities)
Question: What triggers these manual corrections? Understanding this could help us improve our automatic recognition system.

To Resolve These Issues, We Need:

Business Context:


What are the valid status transitions for receipts? (e.g., FLAGGED â†’ FINISHED)
Are there specific rules for bonus point calculations?
What's the expected timeframe between purchase date and scan date?


Technical Information:


Are all fields mandatory, or can some be optional?
What's the source of the barcode data?
How are competitive products and reward groups determined?

Optimization & Scaling Considerations:

Data Volume:


Current analysis shows 1119 receipts with 6941 line items
How many receipts do we expect to process daily/monthly?
What's our data retention policy?


Performance Plans:


Propose implementing partitioning by date for faster queries
Consider materialized views for commonly accessed metrics
Suggest adding indexes for frequent lookup patterns

Next Steps:

Would love to schedule a meeting to discuss these findings and get your input
Need to establish clear data quality thresholds
Define SLAs for receipt processing time

Please let me know when would be a good time to discuss these points in detail. I believe addressing these questions will help us build a more robust and scalable system.

Best regards,
Sri.
